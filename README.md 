# Fundamentals of Signal Processing

Overview

This repository contains Python implementations and explanations for fundamental concepts in signal processing. The goal is to provide educational resources, practical examples, and reusable code for signal processing applications, particularly in the context of EEG-based auditory attention decoding and neuro-steered hearing devices.

Contents

The repository is structured into the following modules:

Basic Signal Operations: Sampling, quantization, and basic transformations.

Fourier Analysis: Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and spectral analysis.

Filtering Techniques: FIR and IIR filters, convolution, and applications.

Time-Frequency Analysis: Wavelets, short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and spectrograms.

EEG Signal Processing: Preprocessing, feature extraction, and decoding techniques.
