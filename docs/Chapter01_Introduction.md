# Chapter 1: Introduction to Signal Processing

Welcome to the **Interactive Signal Processing** book! In this chapter, we lay the foundation for understanding what signals are, why they matter, and how signal processing techniques enable us to extract information, filter noise, and transform signals into meaningful insights.

## 1.1 What is a Signal?

A **signal** is any function that conveys information about a phenomenon. In its most general sense, a signal is a mapping from an independent variable (often time or space) to a set of values. Examples include:

- **Audio Signals:** Sound waves recorded by a microphone.
- **Electrical Signals:** Voltage or current variations in circuits.
- **Image Signals:** Pixel intensity values in photographs.
- **Biological Signals:** Brain activity measured by EEG, heartbeats recorded by ECG, etc.

### Characteristics of Signals
- **Continuous vs. Discrete:**  
  - *Continuous signals* are defined at every instant (e.g., an analog audio waveform).
  - *Discrete signals* are defined only at specific intervals (e.g., digital audio samples).
- **Deterministic vs. Random:**  
  - *Deterministic signals* have a predictable pattern.
  - *Random signals* (or noise) are unpredictable.

## 1.2 Why Signal Processing?

Signal processing is the art and science of analyzing, modifying, and synthesizing signals to improve their quality or extract useful information. It is a field with applications in many areas:
- **Communications:** Ensuring clear transmission of data over noisy channels.
- **Biomedical Engineering:** Interpreting EEG or ECG signals for diagnosis.
- **Audio and Music:** Enhancing recordings, synthesizing sounds, and noise reduction.
- **Image Processing:** Improving image quality and extracting features for computer vision.

By applying mathematical and algorithmic techniques, signal processing enables:
- **Filtering:** Removing unwanted noise from a signal.
- **Transformation:** Changing the signal representation (e.g., from time domain to frequency domain).
- **Analysis:** Extracting features like energy in a specific band, trends, or periodicities.

## 1.3 Signals, Systems, and Convolution

At the heart of many signal processing methods is the concept of **linear systems** and the operation called **convolution**. A linear time-invariant (LTI) system processes an input signal $$x(t)$$ to produce an output $$y(t)$$. The relationship between $$x(t) $$ and $$y(t)$$ is given by:

$$
y(t) = x(t) * h(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) \, h(t - \tau) \, d\tau
$$

where $$h(t)$$ is the **impulse response** of the system. In practice, you’ll often use digital approximations of convolution to simulate system behavior.

> **Interactive Example:**  
> Check out [1_visualizing_convolution.py](./examples/1_visualizing_convolution.py) in the `examples/` folder to see how a unit step function convolved with an exponential decay yields the system’s output.

## 1.4 A Glimpse into the Frequency Domain

One of the most powerful tools in signal processing is the **Fourier Transform**. This mathematical tool decomposes a time-domain signal into its constituent frequencies. In other words, it answers the question: *What frequency components make up this signal?*

- **Time Domain vs. Frequency Domain:**  
  - **Time Domain:** Shows how the signal varies over time.
  - **Frequency Domain:** Shows the amplitude and phase of the signal’s frequency components.

> **Interactive Example:**  
> View [2_visualizing_fourier_transform.py](./examples/2_visualizing_fourier_transform.py) to see how two sine waves at different frequencies are revealed by the Fourier Transform.

## 1.5 Tools and Libraries

Throughout this book, we will leverage powerful Python libraries to implement signal processing techniques. Some key libraries include:

- **NumPy:** For efficient numerical computations.
- **SciPy:** Offering advanced signal processing functions (e.g., filtering, convolution).
- **Matplotlib:** For plotting and visualizing signals.
- **Librosa:** Specialized in audio and music signal processing.
- **PyWavelets:** For wavelet transforms.

Our interactive examples, found in the `examples/` folder, demonstrate how to use these tools to analyze and transform signals.
