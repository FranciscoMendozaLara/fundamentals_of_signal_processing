## 11.2 Advanced Feature Extraction: Envelope Correlation and Spectral Entropy

### Envelope Correlation
Envelope correlation measures the similarity between the envelopes of two signals. It is often computed using the Hilbert transform to obtain the envelope of each signal.

**Code Example: Envelope Correlation**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import hilbert

def envelope_correlation(eeg_signal, audio_envelope):
    """
    Compute the correlation between the envelopes of an EEG signal and an auditory envelope.
    """
    eeg_envelope = np.abs(hilbert(eeg_signal))
    correlation_matrix = np.corrcoef(audio_envelope, eeg_envelope)
    return correlation_matrix[0, 1]

# Example usage:
fs = 250
t = np.linspace(0, 10, fs * 10, endpoint=False)
eeg_signal = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 10 * t) + 0.5 * np.random.randn(len(t))
audio_envelope = np.abs(np.sin(2 * np.pi * 5 * t))

corr_value = envelope_correlation(eeg_signal, audio_envelope)
print(f"Envelope Correlation: {corr_value:.2f}")
```

### Spectral Entropy
Spectral entropy quantifies the disorder or complexity of the power spectrum of a signal. A high spectral entropy indicates a more uniform distribution of power across frequencies, while a low value indicates concentration in specific frequency bands.

### Code Example: Spectral Entropy
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import welch
from scipy.stats import entropy

def spectral_entropy(signal, fs):
    """
    Calculate the spectral entropy of a signal.
    """
    freqs, psd = welch(signal, fs, nperseg=fs*2)
    psd_norm = psd / np.sum(psd)
    return entropy(psd_norm)

# Example usage:
entropy_value = spectral_entropy(eeg_signal, fs)
print(f"Spectral Entropy: {entropy_value:.2f}")
```

## 11.3 Advanced Filtering: Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) Filter
The PHD filter is a powerful multi-target tracking algorithm designed to estimate the number and states of multiple objects in a cluttered environment. It is widely used in applications like radar, sonar, and certain biomedical tracking scenarios.

### Code Example: PHD Filter
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Constants for the PHD Filter
NUM_PARTICLES = 500
SURVIVAL_PROB = 0.95
DETECTION_PROB = 0.9
BIRTH_RATE = 0.1
CLUTTER_RATE = 10
STATE_SPACE = (0, 100)
TIME_STEPS = 10

# Initialize particles and weights
particles = np.random.uniform(STATE_SPACE[0], STATE_SPACE[1], NUM_PARTICLES)
weights = np.full(NUM_PARTICLES, 1.0 / NUM_PARTICLES)

# Simulated true object positions
true_positions = [30, 60]

def simulate_measurements(true_positions):
    measurements = []
    for pos in true_positions:
        if np.random.rand() < DETECTION_PROB:
            measurements.append(pos + np.random.randn() * 1.0)
    # Add clutter
    num_clutter = np.random.poisson(CLUTTER_RATE)
    measurements.extend(np.random.uniform(STATE_SPACE[0], STATE_SPACE[1], num_clutter))
    return measurements

def phd_filter(particles, weights, measurements):
    # Predict step: random walk (motion model)
    particles += np.random.randn(len(particles)) * 1.0
    weights *= SURVIVAL_PROB

    # Birth step: add new particles
    num_births = np.random.poisson(BIRTH_RATE * len(particles))
    if num_births > 0:
        birth_particles = np.random.uniform(STATE_SPACE[0], STATE_SPACE[1], num_births)
        particles = np.concatenate((particles, birth_particles))
        weights = np.concatenate((weights, np.full(num_births, 1.0/len(particles))))

    # Update step: adjust weights based on measurements
    for measurement in measurements:
        likelihood = np.exp(-0.5 * ((particles - measurement) ** 2))
        weights += DETECTION_PROB * likelihood

    # Normalize weights
    weights /= np.sum(weights)

    # Resample particles
    indices = np.random.choice(len(particles), size=NUM_PARTICLES, p=weights)
    particles = particles[indices]
    weights = np.full(NUM_PARTICLES, 1.0 / NUM_PARTICLES)
    return particles, weights

# Run the PHD filter over multiple time steps and plot the results
for t_step in range(TIME_STEPS):
    measurements = simulate_measurements(true_positions)
    true_positions = [pos + np.random.randn() * 0.5 for pos in true_positions]
    particles, weights = phd_filter(particles, weights, measurements)
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 3))
    plt.scatter(particles, np.zeros_like(particles), alpha=0.5, label='Particles')
    plt.scatter(measurements, np.ones_like(measurements), color='red', marker='x', label='Measurements')
    plt.scatter(true_positions, np.full(len(true_positions), -0.1), color='green', marker='D', label='True Positions')
    plt.legend()
    plt.title(f"PHD Filter - Time Step {t_step+1}")
    plt.xlabel("State Space")
    plt.yticks([])
    plt.show()
```

## 11.4 Interactive Exploration
We encourage you to:

- Experiment with Parameters: Modify detection probability, clutter rate, and the number of particles in the PHD filter to observe their impact on tracking performance.
- Combine Features: Integrate envelope correlation and spectral entropy with other features to form a comprehensive feature set for classification or prediction tasks.
- Apply to Real Data: Use these advanced techniques on real-world datasets (e.g., EEG signals, audio recordings, radar data) to analyze their performance and utility.

## 11.5 Exercises
1. Advanced Feature Analysis:
